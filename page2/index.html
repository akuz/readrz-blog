  </h2>

  
    <p>Yesterday a new version of the <a href="http://www.readrz.com">website</a> I was talking about was finally released – horay! It features new section selectors based on <a href="http://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/5944371">Bilevel Partition</a> by <a href="http://bost.ocks.org/mike/">Mike Bostock</a> of <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/">NY Times</a>. Using two circles, it makes it very easy to mix and match data along different dimensions. Front page looks like a search engine (because it is!) now:</p>

    <p>Progress update on cross-section interface design. The menus are ready! The screenshot shows how you would be able to filter the news about the Elections in different Countries.</p>

<p>(You would also be able to select Countries by starting from Elections, however in that case the second menu would be customized for your first selection of Elections.)</p>

<p>Now implementing a new layout for news blocks as discussed in the previous post.</p>

    <small>Oct 10, 2013</small>
  </h2>

  
    <p>Readrz search engine uses several unique algorithms, which in combination provide a service that is not available anywhere else:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Automatic detection of article topics – and search by these topics</li>
  <li>Summarization of multiple articles into a two-level tree</li>
  <li>Cross-sectional topic analysis of results</li>
</ul>

<p>Cross-sectional topic analysis allows you to intersect two topics, and see the results that have both of them. It is the highest-level feature that is supported by all other lower-level functionality. It is the top of the pyramid of code, and it is the most useful feature – it is at the pinnacle of what Readrz can do.</p>

<p>Now, cross-sectional analysis user interface… here we come to the dark area. Of course, you can imagine how that can work. First, you choose one section. Second, you choose another section. And voila, you are looking at the cross-section. You can already do cross-sectional analysis at the current website, which uses two different menus allowing you to choose first and second sections.</p>

<p>Using two menus is not a good idea for cross-sectional user interface:</p>

<ul>
  <li>It looks like a usual user-interface that you see on all websites, so it doesn’t provide any indication that Readrz can do something that other search engines can’t do</li>
  <li>There is no clear indication of a link between two menus – it is not obvious that the second one depends on selection in the first, and that they together produce a cross section of results</li>
</ul>

<p>That’s why we’ve been working on a completely new user interface for cross-sectional search.</p>

<p>Recently, I have learnt about the <a href="http://d3js.org/">D3</a> javascript library, which can do amazing things (data-driven display of information for the web). After that we have spent a few days experimenting and working on the ideas for a new design.</p>

<p>Here is how the home page will approximately look like (using <a href="http://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/5944371">Bilevel Partition Sunburst</a>):</p>

<p>I am attaching some sketches that show how cross-sectional design will work (see below).</p>

<p>I am working hard on implementing it right now…</p>

    <small>Oct 7, 2013</small>
  </h2>

  
    <p>I have been experimenting with <a href="http://d3js.org/">D3</a> trying to use smart layouts for displaying table of contents. I mainly looked at Packed Circles and Treemap.</p>

<p>These layouts are very useful for highlighting the biggest items in a collection. But I decided that why neither of these layouts is suitable for displaying table of contents, which has a number of small items that are comparable in size.</p>

  </picture>

<p><br /></p>

<p>What I am trying to achieve is to minimize the time that a user would need to skim through the table of contents. But these layouts do not provide any linear strategy for a user to look through all the items. You can never be sure you have seen all of the items.</p>

<p>If the table of contents was represented as a plain list, then the strategy is simple – look through the entire list. However, the table of contents needs to be compact. And so the only reasonable option that remains is a table. User could look through all cells in a table by looking through individual rows (or columns). Additional styling (like font size) can help in locating the most prominent entries quickly.</p>

    <p>Millions of news, blog articles, and status updates are published every day. You like to know what is going on in the news (let’s just call it news, even if it’s actually a blog post). So what are the options you have in the Internet?</p>

<h4 id="curated-media">Curated Media</h4>

<p>You rely on your favourite manually curated website that selects the news for you. You may read through a few of such websites. This gives you access to content with predictably good quality. But at the same time, you relinquish your control of what information (and what opinions) get a chance to appear before your eyes. You are under a total control of your selected news source(s).</p>

<h4 id="social-voting">Social Voting</h4>

<p>You visit your favourite social voting site (<a href="http://www.reddit.com/">Reddit</a>, <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/">Hacker News</a>, <a href="http://digg.com/">Digg</a>). You look through top 20 links. You read the discussions. This gives you something to feed your brain with. You expect the community to produce the top links that would be generally relevant to your area of interest. This is great, as it gives you a fine entry point to the world of information. But this is also very limited. It’s like using MTV top 20 to get to know what’s going on in the world of music.</p>

<h4 id="aggregator-sites">Aggregator Sites</h4>

<p>The news are grouped by how similar they are to each other, and then packed into a predefined set of standard sections. Think <a href="https://news.google.com/">Google News</a>, <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/">Yahoo News</a>, <a href="http://news360.com/">News360</a>. You can browse overall top news. You can also choose a section and browse top news within that section. Within each group of news, you can explore other articles – which provides you with an additional dose of objectivity that is lacking within the curated media and social voting sites. Already better. But is this all that can be achieved? No.</p>

<h4 id="like-filter-bubble">“Like” (Filter Bubble)</h4>

<p>Don’t people all have different interests? Let’s give them a chance to tell us what their interests are, and we can learn from them, and show them better quality news tailored for each one of them! Of course, we cannot ask people to actually type in their key words, people are so lazy these days. But surely people can click like or dislike button on a specific news article. We can then use sophisticated algorithms to infer the interests of a specific person, and then overlay this on top of our aggregated news feed, and make everyone happy by showing them the news they would actually like. Think <a href="http://zite.com/">Zite</a>, and the above aggregators.</p>

<p>Isn’t it great? No. Here are the reasons why (and what can be done about it).</p>
