Yesterday a new version of the [website]({{ site.url_readrz }}) I was talking about was finally released – horay! It features new section selectors based on [Bilevel Partition](http://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/5944371) by [Mike Bostock](http://bost.ocks.org/mike/) of [NY Times](http://www.nytimes.com/). Using two circles, it makes it very easy to mix and match data along different dimensions. Front page looks like a search engine (because it is!) now:

Countries section is selected, showing all news about different countries:

<br />

Countries section and Finance “related” section are selected, showing financial news about all countries, sorted by the volume of financial news about each country:

Please go and [check it out]({{ site.url_readrz }}) for yourself.
