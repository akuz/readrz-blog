Progress update on cross-section interface design. The menus are ready! The screenshot shows how you would be able to filter the news about the Elections in different Countries.

(You would also be able to select Countries by starting from Elections, however in that case the second menu would be customized for your first selection of Elections.)

Now implementing a new layout for news blocks as discussed in the previous post.
