The performance of story navigation using calendar has been improved. 
Now when you click a date on the story calendar, the time needed to 
show the relevant articles from that date is significantly shorter.

We are now working on the search functionality, which will allow you 
to search for stories based on key words. Additionally, if you register 
a profile, you will be able to add favourite words to your profile, 
and then see the stories most relevant to you in a separate tab, 
so you donâ€™t need to search every time you come back.
