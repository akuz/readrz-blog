I think this is my best GUI prototype so far.
It can actually achieve the original goal of “going deeper into the data”.
It also highlights the history of what user selected to get the final data to look at.
I think it makes it easy to go back one step back.

Drawbacks:

* Categorization is not shown by default
* The need to zoom out after you select some category, if you want to select a “sister” category
  * For example, I select “Countries”, and then instead I want to select companies
  * I would have to “zoom out” of countries, and then select “Companies” – two clicks!
  * This problem could be solved by replacing circle with tabs
  * However, this would introduce another problem
    * User would need to click twice to go into Countries/Europe
    * Instead of just zooming in using the same circle...

#### All – Magazine

* Default front page
* Showing “All” in “Magazine” mode
* User can select different ways to look at data (tabs)

#### All – Summary

* Showing “All” in “Summary” mode
* Summary shows two levels of key words in a grid
* On mouse over, top article for selected key words is shown
* Key words can be clicked, which results in “Search” (see below)
