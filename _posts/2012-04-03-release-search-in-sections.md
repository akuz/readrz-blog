Today we have released a first version of search! At the moment, you 
can only search within the currently selected section on the left. 
We are working on cross-sectional global search, and it will be released 
in the near future. Below are example of some searches… 

Search for “football” within the Celebrities section brings up 
Daniel Redcliffe’s opinions about footballers plus another story 
about the romance of a famous footballer:
