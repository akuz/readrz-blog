Recently, I [posted a link](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=6659122) to Readrz to Hacker News. It was on the front page for about 10-20 minutes. Around 600 people came during that time. Got some feedback, and here is the summary:

* The time of posting to HN is important (when I posted the link, most of the US was still asleep)
* Dynamics: Day 1 – 600 visits, Day 2 – 100 visits, Day 3 – 50 visits, Day 4 – 20 visits
* Important to get the users into the loop – I didn’t have forms to sign up or share buttons
* Therefore, I lost all the users that came on that day – although, I could have kept them
* User interface:
  * It was not good enough, otherwise it would stay longer on the front page
  * Some people really liked the circle section selector
  * One person said it’s hard to look through it – agree
  * But the circle has obvious benefit of showing two levels – something in exchange
  * The second circle really confuses people what it’s all about...

I will be posting mock ups of the updated GUI based on feedback, and then get to work on it.
