Welcome to the Readrz Blog from the founders of <a href="{{ site.url_readrz }}">Readrz.com</a>.

Here we want to share some info about what has been done on the project so far. 
We would also highly value any feedback and thoughts about the future development.

The current vision for Readrz is that we are automating the creation of magazines 
from thousands of news articles available on the web. We use statistics to detect 
articles related to each other and group them into stories spread over time. 
We then try to use our modest UI skills to provide you a convenient user 
interface to navigate these stories.

We have a bunch of other ideas to build on top of this. I bet you can easily 
start to imagine them too. However, given limited resources, it is very hard 
to know at this time which ones we will pursue first. We will follow up on 
the developments as we go along.
