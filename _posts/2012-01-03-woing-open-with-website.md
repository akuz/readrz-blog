We have decided to make <a href="{{ site.url_readrz }}">Readrz.com</a> 
website open for access by anyone. 
Not all of the features we wanted to implement before the first 
release are ready. The features still being in progress are:

1. Search
1. User profiles
1. User favourites
1. iPhone/Android App

However, we have decided to go ahead and open the current website to wider audience anyway. 
The current magazines available on the website are refreshed every 6 hours. In the future, 
this process can be made faster, including the option for live updates on user selected stories.

We also have a better algorithm lined up for funding the evolution of stories over time 
to capture more time-context-dependent articles (based on what was going on at a particular 
point in time). We expect the ranking of articles with regard to news stories over time will 
be more precise and context dependent with the new algorithm.
