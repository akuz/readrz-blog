This is a blog about our ideas and experiences while developing <a href="http://www.readrz.com">Readrz.com</a>

There were multiple versions of the website, all of which are currently suspended.

It is possible that by virtue of magic, some the ideas or the code might be reincarnated.

Hopefully, this blog can provide some overview of what was going on.

You can find the publicly released code at [<i class="fa fa-github"></i> akuz/readrz-public](https://github.com/akuz/readrz-public)
